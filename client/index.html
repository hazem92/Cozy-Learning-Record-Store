              <h2>Welcome To Cozy Learning Record Store Application User Interface <br>
              </h2>
              <p>
                We are creating a Learning Record Store
                for Tin Can (xAPI) as a cozy application in a special personal cloud called Cozy cloud.<br>
                This project will allow Tin can users to protect more their data and introduce the power of cozy cloud to eLearning world.
              </p>   <h3>
                This application accomplishes three main tasks :
                </h3> <p>
                	1- The first and most important is its role as learning store record for applications
                	   using the standard Tin can (xAPI).<br>
                	   The Learning Record store uses Cozy cloud for the storage of Data (Statements,..).<br>
                 	   Applications implementing Tin can and willing to use this cozy app as an LRS can be
                 	   "First-party client" or "Third-party client" <br> towards Cozy cloud.<br> In the second case
                 	   our cozy application will handle authentication and authorization processes (oauth2).
                  </p><p>
                	2- Our application gives the opportunity to the owner of Cozy cloud to get a review on
                	   the Data stored in the cloud <br> and execute some operations easily via our user interface.
                	   The range of these operations can be easily extended.
                  </p><p>
                	3- Since authentication and authorization for "Third-party client" is not supported on
                	   Cozy cloud, we included <br>an authentication and authorization server to our application
                	   to allow "Third-party client" applications (towards cozy) <br>and implementing Tin can to
                	   use our cozy application as a Learning Record Store.
                  </p> <p>
                    This is a project for third-year students of Telecom Bretagne.<br><br>
